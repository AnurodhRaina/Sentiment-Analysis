## What is sentiment analysis?
Sentiment Analysis is the process of automatically identifying and extracting subjective information from text data, such as opinions, emotions, and attitudes expressed by the author. It is a subfield of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that aims to determine the polarity of a given text as either positive, negative, or neutral. This technique is widely used in various fields, such as customer service, marketing, and political analysis, to gain insights into public opinion and sentiments towards a particular product, service, or issue.
The results of sentiment analysis on tweets can be used for various applications such as brand monitoring, marketing research, and crisis management.
